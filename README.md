Project Euler
============

These are my solutions for project euler problems.
http://projecteuler.net/

These problems are solved by using [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) programming language. They don't depend on any extra libraries but some of them will need a JavaScript engine that supports [ECMAScript 5](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/) features like native [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) functions for arrays.

Easiest way to run the problem is to go to the project's [Github page](http://jweak.github.io/projecteuler/). It has a GUI built to run the problems right in the browser.
